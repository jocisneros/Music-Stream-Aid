# Music Stream Aid
A Python application that uses the web development capabilities of Flask,
and the GUI capabilities of Tkinter. Will be used to aid livestreams on Twitch.tv

Written in Python (3.8.3)

Current 3rd Party Resources Used:
- flask library
- requests library
- Pillow library
- Spotify Web API

Future compatibility with Twitch API is expected, currently finding a work-around as their API is not Desktop-Application friendly.
